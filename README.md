#  Mini Game Website

Welcome to the **Mini Game Website** – a fun and interactive platform where you can enjoy simple yet entertaining browser games!

##  About the Project

This is a beginner-friendly mini web-based game center built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It offers users an easy and enjoyable experience with three classic games:

- **Tic Tac Toe**

- **Number Guessing Game**

Each game is implemented in its own HTML file, and all are accessible through the main page `Basic Games.html`, which serves as the central hub of the website.
